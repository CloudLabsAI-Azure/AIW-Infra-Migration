# Lab 01: Discover your Windows Server

### Estimated Duration: 60 minutes

In this Hands-on Lab, you will discover on-prem servers using use Azure Migrate Appliance. The Azure Migrate appliance is a tool provided by Microsoft to assist in the discovery and assessment of on-premises infrastructure for migration to Azure. It collects detailed information about servers, applications, databases, and workloads in your environment, including configuration, performance, and dependencies.

## Exercise: Discovery, Assess, and Plan: Evaluate your current environment

In this exercise, you will deploy the Azure Migrate appliance in the on-premises Hyper-V environment. This appliance communicates with the Hyper-V server to gather configuration and performance data about your on-premises VMs, and returns that data to your Azure Migrate project.

2. On the Azure portal click on **Show Portal Menu (1)** bar and select **All services (2)** in the portal's left navigation.
