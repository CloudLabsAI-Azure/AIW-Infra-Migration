# Lab 01: Migrate Windows Servers from Hyper-V to Azure

### Duration: 45 minutes

## Exercise 1: Migrating your apps and your data, leveraging Microsoft services and tools including Azure Migrate: Server Migration

In this Guided Lab, you will learn about Azure migration and how all pre-migration steps such as discovery, assessments, and right-sizing of on-premises resources are included for infrastructure, data, and applications. Azure Migrate provides a simplified migration, modernization, and optimization service for Azure.

### Task 1: Create a Storage Account

In this task, you will create a new Azure Storage Account that will be used by Migration and for storage of your virtual machine data during migration.

> **Note:** This lab focuses on the technical tools required for workload migration. In a real-world scenario, more consideration should go into the long-term plan prior to migrating assets. The landing zone required to host VMs should also include considerations for network traffic, access control, resource organization, and governance. For example, the CAF Migration Blueprint and CAF Foundation Blueprint can be used to deploy a pre-defined landing zone and demonstrate the potential of an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach to infrastructure resource management. For more information, see [Azure Landing Zones](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/) and [Cloud Adoption Framework Azure Migration landing zone Blueprint sample](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/blueprints/samples/caf-migrate-landing-zone/).

1. In the Azure portal's left navigation, select **+ Create a resource**, then search for and select **Storage account**, followed by **Create**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the create storage account navigation.](Images/1.1.png "Storage account - Create")

2. In the **Create storage account** blade, on the **Basics** tab, use the following values:

   - Subscription: **Select your Azure subscription (1)**.
  
   - Resource group: **AzureMigrateRG (2)**
  
   - Storage account name: **migrationstorage<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (3)**

   - Location: Select **<inject key="Region" enableCopy="false" /> (4)** from the dropdown.
    
   - Performance: **Standard (5)**
  
   - Redundancy: **Locally-redundant storage (LRS) (6)**

     ![Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the create storage account blade.](Images/HOL1-EX3-T1-S2.png "Storage account settings")

3. Select **Review**, then select **Create**.

4. Once the storage account is deployed, click on **Go to resource** to open it.

5. Select **Data protection** under **Data management** from the left-hand side menu of storage account.

   ![Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the create storage account blade.](Images/1.3.png)

6. Now, uncheck the box next to **Enable soft delete for blobs** and **Enable soft delete for containers** to disable the soft delete on blobs and containers as the soft delete enabled storage account is **not supported** for enabling replication on Virtual Machines. Click on **Save**.

#### Task summary 

In this task, you enabled replication from the Hyper-V host to Azure Migrate and configured the replicated VM size in Azure.

### Task 4: Configure Networking

In this task, you will modify the settings for each replicated VM to use a static private IP address that matches the on-premises IP addresses for that machine.

1. Still using the **Migration and modernization - Replicating machines** blade, select the **smarthotelweb1** virtual machine. This opens a detailed migration and replication blade for this machine. Take a moment to study this information.

    ![](Images/t4s1.png)

2. Select **Compute and Network (1)** under **General** on the left, then select **Edit (2)**.

    ![Screenshot of the smarthotelweb1 blade with the 'Compute and Network' and 'Edit' links highlighted.](Images/upd-config-1.png "Edit Compute and Network settings")

3. Confirm that the VM is configured to use the **F2s_v2** VM size.

4. Under **Network Interfaces**, select **InternalNATSwitch** to open the network interface settings.

    ![Screenshot showing the link to edit the network interface settings for a replicated VM.](Images/upd-nic.png "Network Interface settings link")

5. Change the **Private IP address** to **192.168.0.4**

    ![Screenshot showing a private IP address being configured for a replicated VM in ASR.](Images/upd-private-ip.png "Network interface - static private IP address")

6. Select **OK** to close the network interface settings blade, then **Save** the **smarthotelweb1** settings.

7. Repeat these steps to configure the private IP address for the other VMs.
 
   - For **smarthotelweb2** use private IP address **192.168.0.5**

#### Task summary 

In this task, you modified the settings for each replicated VM to use a static private IP address that matches the on-premises IP addresses for that machine

> **Note**: Azure Migrate makes a "best guess" at the VM settings, but you have full control over the settings of migrated items. In this case, setting a static private IP address ensures the virtual machines in Azure retain the same IPs they had on-premises, which avoids having to reconfigure the VMs during migration (for example, by editing web.config files).

### Task 5: Server migration

In this task, you will perform a migration of the UbuntuWAF, smarthotelweb1, and smarthotelweb2 machines to Azure.

> **Note**: In a real-world scenario, you would perform a test migration before the final migration. To save time, you will skip the test migration in this lab. The test migration process is very similar to the final migration.

1. Return to the **Migration and modernization** overview blade. Under **Step 3: Migrate**, select **Migrate**.

    ![](Images/t5s1.png)

1. On the **Specify intent** tab, Select **Azure VM** under Where do you want to migrate to? and select **Continue**.

    ![](Images/t5s2.png)

3. On the **Migrate** blade, select **yes (1)** for **Shutdown machines before migration to minimum data loss** and select the 2 virtual machines **(2)** then select **Migrate (3)** to start the migration process.

    ![](Images/t5s3.png)

   > **Note**: You can optionally choose whether the on-premises virtual machines should be automatically shut down before migration to minimize data loss. Either setting will work for this lab.

4. The migration process will start.

    ![](Images/t5s4.png)

5. To monitor progress, select **Jobs (1)** under **Migration** on the left and review the status of the two **Planned failover (2)** jobs.

    ![](Images/t5s5.png)

6. **Wait** until all two **Planned failover** jobs show **Status** to **Successful**. You should not need to refresh your browser. This could take up to 15 minutes.

    ![](Images/t5s6.png)

7. Navigate to the **SmartHotelHostRG** resource group and check that the VM, network interface, and disk resources have been created for each of the virtual machines being migrated.

    ![](Images/t5s7.png)

    > **Congratulations** on completing the task! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:
    > - If you receive a success message, you can proceed to the next task.
    > - If not, carefully read the error message and retry the step, following the instructions in the lab guide.

    <validation step="e4fc8753-2a84-4e27-8b12-cb43582a0e6c" />

#### Task summary 

In this task, you assigned a public IP address to the UbuntuWAF VM and verified that the SmartHotel application is now working in Azure.

### Task 6: Pointers around Azure Networking and Azure Network Security (Read only)

Design and implementation of Azure networking is one of the most critical steps in migrating your infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) implementations in Azure.

#### Azure Networking Best Practises:

- Assign an address space that is not larger than a CIDR range of /16 for each virtual network. Virtual networks allow for the use of 65,536 IP addresses. Assigning a smaller prefix than /16, such as a /15, which has 131,072 addresses, will result in the excess IP addresses becoming unusable elsewhere. It is important not to waste IP addresses, even if they're in the private ranges defined by RFC 1918.

- The hub is an Azure virtual network that acts as a central point of connectivity. The spokes are virtual networks that connect to the hub virtual network by using peering. Shared services are deployed in the hub, while individual workloads are deployed as spokes.

- To provide isolation within a virtual network, you segment it into one or more subnets and give a portion of the virtual network's address space to each subnet.

- Azure adds a DNS server by default when you deploy a virtual network. You can use this server to rapidly build virtual networks and deploy resources.

- DNS servers in a virtual network can forward DNS queries to the recursive resolvers in Azure. This forwarding enables you to resolve host names within that virtual network.

- DNS forwarding allows VMs to see both your on-premises resources (via the domain controller) and Azure-provided host names (using the forwarder). You can access the recursive resolvers in Azure by using the virtual IP address 168.63.129.16.

- DNS forwarding also enables DNS resolution between virtual networks and allows on-premises machines to resolve host names provided by Azure.

- A VPN gateway is a specific type of virtual network gateway. It sends encrypted traffic between an Azure virtual network and an on-premises location over the public internet.

- A VPN gateway can also send encrypted traffic between virtual networks in Azure over the Microsoft network. Each virtual network can have only one VPN gateway.

#### Azure Network Security Best Practises:

- Azure Site Recovery enables disaster recovery and migration to Azure for on-premises Hyper-V virtual machines, VMware virtual machines, and physical servers. For all on-premises to Azure scenarios, replication data is sent to and stored in an Azure Storage account.

- Once VMs have been created after failover to Azure, NSGs can be used to limit network traffic to the virtual network and VMs. Site Recovery does not create NSGs as part of the failover operation.

- We can create the required Azure NSGs before initiating failover. You can then associate NSGs to failed over VMs automatically during failover, using automation scripts with Site Recovery's powerful recovery plans.

- Once the NSGs are created and configured, we can run a test failover to verify scripted NSG associations and post-failover VM connectivity.


### Task 7:  Migrating VMware VMs to Azure (Read only)

Azure Migrate is a free tool from Microsoft that allows VMware administrators to replicate their VMs from on-prem to Azure. It is an extremely powerful tool that even allows for pre-migration tests to run.

Azure Migrate has two migration options:

- Migration with an agent for replication, requires an agent to be installed on each VM that is to be migrated.
- Migration using agentless replication, requires an agentless format which requires no agent.

**Discovery/Assessment**:

 Discover up to 10,000 VMware VMs with a single Azure Migrate appliance for VMware. The appliance supports adding multiple vCenter Servers. You can add up to 10 vCenter Servers per appliance.
 

#### Agentless migration: 

- Agentless migration uses the Azure Migrate appliance. You can deploy the appliance as a VMware VM using an OVA template, imported into the vCenter Server, or using a PowerShell script.

- you can simultaneously replicate a maximum of 500 VMs across multiple vCenter Servers (discovered from one appliance) using a scale-out appliance.

- If you are interested in learning more about Agentless migration, you can [read more here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/tutorial-migrate-vmware).

#### Agent-based migration: 

- Agent-based migration does not use the Azure Migrate appliance. If you've set up an appliance for assessment, you can leave it in place, or remove it if you're done with assessment.

- you can scale out the replication appliance to replicate large numbers of VMs.

- If you are interested in learning more about Agent-based migration, you can [read more here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/tutorial-migrate-vmware-agent).

In the portal, you can select up to 10 machines at once for replication. To replicate more machines, add in batches of 10.

#### Summary 

In this lab, you learned how to migrate Windows Servers from Hyper-V to Azure using Azure Migrate: Server Migration. You created a storage account for migration data, registered your Hyper-V host with Azure Migrate, and configured replication for virtual machines. You set up networking with static IPs for replicated VMs, performed a migration, and reviewed network and security best practices. The lab provided essential knowledge on discovery, replication, and migration to Azure.
