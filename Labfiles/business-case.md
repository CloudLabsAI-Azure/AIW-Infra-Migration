## HOL3: Exercise 6: Business case analysis capability (Read-only)

In this exercise, you'll learn how to create a business case for Azure, using a free Azure Migrate feature during assessments that will help simplify your move to Azure.

Managing your on-premises data centres can present time-bound challenges such as expiring contracts, ageing hardware, and end-of-support software. You may also be under pressure to address cash flow challenges, add capacity, and prevent security attacks while ensuring business continuity.

To understand if Azure makes financial sense, we will start by creating a directional business case with Azure Migrate. This helps you understand what the best migration strategy is for your business and how to gradually move from a capital expenditure model to an operating expenditure model, where you only pay for what you use.

**Business case analysis** is a comprehensive, easy-to-use tool that enables customers and partners to create directional business proposals to understand how Azure can bring the most value to their business.

> **Note:** You don't need to perform this task as it is a read-only exercise.

**Features:**

- Need **minimal inputs** to get started.

- Includes **migration strategy recommendation** including lift-and-shift to IaaS and modernize to PaaS.

- Highlights **on-premises TCO, ROI** and financial analysis, **resource utilization-based insights and quick wins**.

- Enables creating **what-if** scenarios with customizable settings and assumptions.

1. On the **Build business case** blade, enter the following details:
   
   - **Business case name:** Enter **Contoso (1)**
   - **Target location:** Select any available region **(2)**
   - **Migration prefrence:** Select the **Minimize migration time (3)**
   - **Preferred time:** Azure VM **(4)**
   - **Savings Option:** Select **Reserved Instance + Azure Savings Plan (5)**
   - **Discount(%) on Pay as you go:** Enter **0 (6)**
   - **Currency:** Select **US Dollar ($) (7)**
   - Click on **Build business case (8)**

9. On the **TCO Comparison** blade, observe the cost. It represents an estimated on-premises cost versus Azure TCO and the potential savings possible by getting rid of components that you'll no longer need. 

     ![](Images/infra-new-5.png)
   
10. The **YoY estimated current vs future state cost** presents a year-over-year cost breakdown of the estimated current versus future state.

12. Based on the rich data insights collected during the discovery process, on the **Recommended migration strategy blade**, you can observe how to effectively migrate to Azure, which underutilized servers to the right size, and which unused servers to potentially decommission.

13. Under **Business case reports (1)**, click on **Azure Iaas (2)**. You can dive deeper into detailed Azure Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service reports. IaaS Reports will provide you with recommended right-sized targets and the most cost-effective offers based on your usage.

15. Click on **Azure PaaS** from the left navigation pane under **Business case reports**. You'll find recommendations in the PaaS reports identifying quick wins and the ideal right-sized targets for your database and application workloads.

16. Given the importance of what-if scenarios and customizations in the planning process, use new settings to override default assumptions and build a business case for your migration strategy. We can present this business case to your stakeholders, obtain buy-ins, and know that you've taken the steps to make the right decisions for your business.

### Summary

In this exercise, you explored the Azure Migrate Business Case feature to evaluate the financial benefits of moving to Azure. You reviewed TCO and ROI comparisons, migration strategy recommendations, and cost-saving insights through IaaS and PaaS reports.

### You have successfully completed this Hands-on lab.

By completing this lab Infrastructure Migration, you gained hands-on experience in assessing, migrating, and protecting on-premises workloads using Azure. You began by exploring Azure Migrate projects, configuring the appliance, and performing assessments with dependency visualization. You then registered a Hyper-V host, created storage accounts, and enabled replication of VMs to Azure with Azure Site Recovery. Next, you tested migration scenarios by performing live VM migrations, setting static IPs, and enabling Automanage, AAD authentication, and Managed Identities for secure management. You also deployed Azure Arc-enabled servers to extend management to non-Azure machines. Finally, you validated disaster recovery strategies by configuring replication policies, performing test failovers, and executing a full failover to Azure to ensure business continuity.
