# Exercise 03: Setup test failover

### Estimated time: 25 Minutes

In this exercise, you will deploy a Test Failover to the replicated Virtual Machine which allows you to test the sanity of the virtualized workload without interrupting your production workload or ongoing replication.

## Lab objectives

In this exercise, you will complete the following task:

- Task 1: Setup Test Failover

## Task 1: Setup Test Failover

1. On the **Recovery Service Vault page**, expand the **Protected Items (1)** and click on **Replicated Items (2)** and select **AzureArcVM (3)** that you replicated in the previous exercise.

## Summary

In this exercise, you learnt how to validate the replication and disaster recovery strategy by testing a failover, that too without any data loss or downtime.
