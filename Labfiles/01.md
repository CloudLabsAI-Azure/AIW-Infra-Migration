# Module 1: Migrating Windows & SQL Server workloads

Duration: 60 minutes

In this Module, you will use Azure Migrate: Server Assessment to assess the on-premises environment. This will include selecting Azure Migrate tools, deploying the Azure Migrate appliance into the on-premises environment, creating a migration assessment, and using the Azure Migrate dependency visualization.

### Exercise 1: Discovery, Assess, and Plan: Evaluate your current environment

In this exercise, you will deploy the Azure Migrate appliance in the on-premises Hyper-V environment. This appliance communicates with the Hyper-V server to gather configuration and performance data about your on-premises VMs, and returns that data to your Azure Migrate project.

### Task 2: Configure dependency visualization

When migrating a workload to Azure, it is important to understand all workload dependencies. A broken dependency could mean that the application doesn't run properly in Azure, perhaps in hard-to-detect ways. Some dependencies, such as those between application tiers, are obvious. Other dependencies, such as DNS lookups, Kerberos ticket validation or certificate revocation checks, are not.

In this task, you will configure the Azure Migrate dependency visualization feature. This requires you to first create a Log Analytics workspace, and then to deploy agents on the to-be-migrated VMs.

1. Return to the **Azure Migrate** blade in the Azure Portal, select **Servers, databases and web apps (1)**. Under **Discovery and assessment** select **Groups (2)**,

    ![](Images/E1T5S1.png)

7. In the **Disks** tab, review the settings but do not make any changes. Select **Next: Tags**, then select **Replicate** to start the server replication.

8. In the **Azure Migrate - Servers, databases and web apps** blade, under **Migration and modernization**, select the **Overview** button.

    ![Screenshot of the 'Azure Migrate - Servers' blade with the 'Overview' button in the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration' panel highlighted.](Images/overviewnew.png "Overview link")
    
9. Confirm that the 3 machines are replicating.

   ![Screenshot of the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration' overview blade showing the replication state as 'Healthy' for 3 servers.](Images/replicate-8.png "Replication summary")

10. Select **Replicating Machines** under **Manage** on the left.  Select **Refresh** occasionally and wait until all three machines have a **Protected** status, which shows the initial replication is complete. This will take 5-10 minutes.

    ![Screenshot of the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration - Replicating machines' blade showing the replication status as 'Protected' for all 3 servers.](Images/replicate-9.png "Replication status")

   > **Note**: Please make sure to run the **validation steps** for this task before moving to next tasks as there are few dependencies. **Not** running the validation after performing this task will result in **validation failure**  as the status of the Virtual Machine will be changed from **Protected** to **Planned  failover** when you migrate the servers in Task6.

#### Task summary 

In this task you enabled replication from the Hyper-V host to Azure Migrate, and configured the replicated VM size in Azure.

### Task 3: Configure Networking

In this task you will modify the settings for each replicated VM to use a static private IP address that matches the on-premises IP addresses for that machine.

1. Still using the **Migration and modernization - Replicating machines** blade, select the **smarthotelweb1** virtual machine. This opens a detailed migration and replication blade for this machine. Take a moment to study this information.

   ![Screenshot from the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration - Replicating machines' blade with the smarthotelweb1 machine highlighted.](Images/config-0.png "Replicating machines")

2. Select **Compute and Network** under **General** on the left, then select **Edit**.

   ![Screenshot of the smarthotelweb1 blade with the 'Compute and Network' and 'Edit' links highlighted.](Images/config-1.png "Edit Compute and Network settings")

3. Confirm that the VM is configured to use the **F2s_v2** VM size.

4. Under **Network Interfaces**, select **InternalNATSwitch** to open the network interface settings.

   ![Screenshot showing the link to edit the network interface settings for a replicated VM.](Images/nic.png "Network Interface settings link")

5. Change the **Private IP address** to **192.168.0.4**.

   ![Screenshot showing a private IP address being configured for a replicated VM in ASR.](Images/private-ip.png "Network interface - static private IP address")

6. Select **OK** to close the network interface settings blade, then **Save** the **smarthotelweb1** settings.

7. Repeat these steps to configure the private IP address for the other VMs.
 
   - For **smarthotelweb2** use private IP address **192.168.0.5**
  
   - For **UbuntuWAF** use private IP address **192.168.0.8**

#### Task summary 

In this task you modified the settings for each replicated VM to use a static private IP address that matches the on-premises IP addresses for that machine

> **Note**: Azure Migrate makes a "best guess" at the VM settings, but you have full control over the settings of migrated items. In this case, setting a static private IP address ensures the virtual machines in Azure retain the same IPs they had on-premises, which avoids having to reconfigure the VMs during migration (for example, by editing web.config files).


### Task 4: Server migration

In this task you will perform a migration of the UbuntuWAF, smarthotelweb1, and smarthotelweb2 machines to Azure.

> **Note**: In a real-world scenario, you would perform a test migration before the final migration. To save time, you will skip the test migration in this lab. The test migration process is very similar to the final migration.

1. Return to the **Migration and modernization** overview blade. Under **Step 3: Migrate**, select **Migrate**.

   ![Screenshot of the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration' overview blade, with the 'Migrate' button highlighted.](Images/migrate-1.png "Replication summary")

2. On the **Migrate** blade, select **yes** for **Shutdown machines before migration to minimum data loss** and select the 3 virtual machines then select **Migrate** to start the migration process.

   ![Screenshot of the 'Migrate' blade, with 3 machines selected and the 'Migrate' button highlighted.](Images/e3%20t6%20ss2.png?raw=true "Migrate - VM selection")

   > **Note**: You can optionally choose whether the on-premises virtual machines should be automatically shut down before migration to minimize data loss. Either setting will work for this lab.

3. The migration process will start.

   ![Screenshot showing 3 VM migration notifications.](Images/migrate-3.png "Migration started notifications")

4. To monitor progress, select **Jobs** under **Manage** on the left and review the status of the three **Planned failover** jobs.

   ![Screenshot showing the **Jobs* link and a jobs list with 3 in-progress 'Planned failover' jobs.](Images/migrate-4.png "Migration jobs")

5. **Wait** until all three **Planned failover** jobs show a **Status** of **Successful**. You should not need to refresh your browser. This could take up to 15 minutes.

   ![Screenshot showing the **Jobs* link and a jobs list with all 'Planned failover' jobs successful.](Images/migrate-5.png "Migration status")

6. Navigate to the **SmartHotelRG** resource group and check that the VM, network interface, and disk resources have been created for each of the virtual machines being migrated.

   ![Screenshot showing resources created by the test failover (VMs, disks, and network interfaces).](Images/migrate-6.png "Migrated resources")

#### Task summary 

In this task you used Azure Migrate to create Azure VMs using the settings you have configured, and the data replicated from the Hyper-V machines. This migrated your on-premises VMs to Azure.


### Task 5: Configure the database connection

The application tier machine **smarthotelweb2** is configured to connect to the application database running on the **smarthotelsql** machine.

On the migrated VM **smarthotelweb2**, this configuration needs to be updated to use the Azure SQL Database instead.

> **Note**: You do not need to update any configuration files on **smarthotelweb1** or the **UbuntuWAF** VMs, since the migration has preserved the private IP addresses of all virtual machines they connect with.

1. From the Azure portal menu which is present at the top left, click on **All services**. Select **compute** from the left hand menu and select **Virtual machines**.

2. Click on **smarthotelweb2** VM, from the overview blade, and select **Connect**. Select **Bastion** from the available options and click on **Use Bastion**.

   **Note:** You may have to wait a few minutes and refresh to have the option to enter the credentials. 

3. Connect to the machine with the username **Administrator** and the password <inject key="SmartHotelHost Admin Password"></inject>. When prompted, **Allow** clipboard access.

   ![Screenshot showing the Azure Bastion connection blade.](Images/web2-connect.png "Connect using Bastion")

4. In the **smarthotelweb2** remote desktop session, open File Explorer and navigate to the **C:\\inetpub\\SmartHotel.Registration.Wcf** folder. Double-select the **Web.config** file and open with Notepad.

5. Update the **DefaultConnection** setting to connect to your Azure SQL Database.

   You can find the connection string for the Azure SQL Database in the Azure portal. Navigate to the **SmartHotelRG** resource group, and then to the database **smarthoteldb** and  from the overview, select **Show database connection strings**.

   ![Screenshot showing the 'Show database connection strings' link for an Azure SQL Database.](Images/show-connection-strings.png "Show database connection strings")

    Copy the **ADO.NET** connection string, and paste into the web.config file on **smarthotelweb2**, replacing the existing connection string.  **Be careful not to overwrite the 'providerName' parameter which is specified after the connection string.**

    > **Note:** You may need to open the clipboard panel on the left-hand edge of the Bastion window, paste the connection string there, and then paste into the VM.

    Set the password in the connection string to **<inject key="SmartHotelHost Admin Password" />**.

    ![Screenshot showing the user ID and Password in the web.config database connection string.](Images/web2-connection-string.png "web.config")

6. **Save** the `web.config` file and exit your Bastion remote desktop session.

#### Task summary 

In this task, you updated the **smarthotelweb2** configuration to connect to the Azure SQL Database.

### Task 6: Configure the public IP address and test the SmartHotel application

In this task, you will associate an Application Gateway with Web Application Firewall (WAF) to replace the Ubuntu VM with the Azure managed service.

1. Navigate to the **SmartHotel-WAF** Application Gateway in the **SmartHotelRG** resource group

1. Select **Backend pools** under the Settings section, and select the **WebBackend** pool

    ![Screenshot showing the backend pool selection for the Application Gateway](Images/waf-backend-pool.png "Select WebBackend")

1. Set the Target type to **Virtual machine** and the Target to the NIC of **smarthotelweb1**; select **Save** to update the backend pool

    ![Screenshot showing virtual machine add to the backend pool of Application Gateway](Images/backendpool-01.png "Add VM to backend pool")

    > **Note:** This backend pool is already associated with the front-end IP address of the Application Gateway via the SmartHotelApp rule. The front-end IP, listener, rule, and backend pool were all created with the Application Gateway. This step now ties the migrated VM to the front end.

1. Navigate to the **SmartHotelRG** resource group, and then to the **SmartHoteldb<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** database server to update the Firewall settings.
           
1. Under Security, select **Networking** then **Public access** tab. Now, set **Public network access** to **Selected networks** and **Save** your changes.

    ![](Images/website1.1.png)
     
1. Now, on the **Public access** tab, click on **Add a virtual network rule** to add a virtual network so that the access to the database will be allowed from specific network.

    ![](Images/website2.1.png)
   
1. On the **Create/Update** blade, enter the below information.

    - **Name**: **AllowaccesstoDB**
    - **Subscription**: Select your subscription from the dropdown.
    - **Virtual Network**: Select **SmartHotelVNet**. 
    - **Subnet**: Select **SmartHotel**.
    - Click on **Enable** and then **Ok**.

    ![](Images/website3.png)
   
1. Navigate back to the **Public access** tab of **Networking** section. Set **Public network access** to **Disabled** and **Save** your changes.

    ![](Images/deny-firewalls-sqlserver1.png)
   
1. Navigate back to the **SmartHotel-WAF** Application Gateway then **Frontend IP configurations** way in the Settings section, and note the IP address associated with the public IP address **appGwPublicFrontendIp**.

    ![Screenshot showing public IP address of the Application Gateway that is now associated with the backend VM.](Images/waf-public-ip-address.png "Public IP address of AppGW")

1. Open a new browser tab and paste the IP address into the address bar. Verify that the SmartHotel360 application is now available in Azure.

    ![Screenshot showing the SmartHotel application.](Images/lob-issue-02.png "Migrated SmartHotel application")
 
    > **Note**: 
      1. The Check-in and Check-out might differ for you when compared to the above screenshot.
      2. At this point the base Application Gateway service is providing access to the backend application. This validates that the application is working and can be further protected by the WAF in following steps.

1. Select **Web application firewall** under the Settings section and change the Tier to **WAF V2**.  Also, change the Firewall status to **Enabled**, the Firewall mode to **Prevention**, and set the Max request body size (KB) to **32**.  Select **Save** to commit the changes.

    ![Screenshot changing Application Gateway to WAF V2 tier and enabling the WAF in prevention mode](Images/waf-enable-waf-v2.png "Enable WAF v2")

1. Once the application gateway changes have been saved, go back to your web browser with the public IP address of the application gateway you used earlier and refresh the browser to have a page processed by the WAF.


#### Task summary 

In this task, you assigned a public IP address to the UbuntuWAF VM and verified that the SmartHotel application is now working in Azure.


### Task 8:  Migrating VMware VMs to Azure (Read only)

Azure Migrate is a free tool from Microsoft that allows VMware administrators to replicate their VMs from on-prem to Azure. It’s an extremely powerful tool that even allows for pre-migration tests to run.

Azure Migrate has two migrations options:

- Migration with an agent for replication, requires an agent to be installed on each VM that is to be migrated.
- Migration using agentless replication, requires an agentless format which requires no agent.

**Discovery/Assessment**:

 Discover up to 10,000 VMware VMs with a single Azure Migrate appliance for VMware. The appliance supports adding multiple vCenter Servers. You can add up to 10 vCenter Servers per appliance.
 

#### Agentless migration: 

- Agentless migration uses the Azure Migrate appliance. You can deploy the appliance as a VMware VM using an OVA template, imported into vCenter Server, or using a PowerShell script.

- you can simultaneously replicate a maximum of 500 VMs across multiple vCenter Servers (discovered from one appliance) using a scale-out appliance.

- If you are interested in learning more about the Agentless migration, you can [read more here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/tutorial-migrate-vmware)

#### Agent-based migration: 

- Agent-based migration does not use the Azure Migrate appliance. If you've set up an appliance for assessment, you can leave it in place, or remove it if you're done with assessment.

- you can scale out the replication appliance to replicate large numbers of VMs.

- If you are interested in learning more about the Agent-based migration, you can [read more here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/tutorial-migrate-vmware-agent)

In the portal, you can select up to 10 machines at once for replication. To replicate more machines, add in batches of 10.
