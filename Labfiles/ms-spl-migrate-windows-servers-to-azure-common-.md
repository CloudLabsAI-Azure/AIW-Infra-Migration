# Migrate Windows Servers from Hyper-V to Azure

## Migrating your apps and your data, leveraging Microsoft services and tools including Azure Migrate: Server Migration

In this Guided Lab, you will learn about Azure migration and how all pre-migration steps such as discovery, assessments, and right-sizing of on-premises resources are included for infrastructure, data, and applications. Azure Migrate provides a simplified migration, modernization, and optimization service for Azure.

### Task 1: Create a Storage Account

In this task, you will create a new Azure Storage Account that will be used by Migration and for storage of your virtual machine data during migration.

> **Note:** This lab focuses on the technical tools required for workload migration. In a real-world scenario, more consideration should go into the long-term plan prior to migrating assets. The landing zone required to host VMs should also include considerations for network traffic, access control, resource organization, and governance. For example, the CAF Migration Blueprint and CAF Foundation Blueprint can be used to deploy a pre-defined landing zone and demonstrate the potential of an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach to infrastructure resource management. For more information, see [Azure Landing Zones](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/) and [Cloud Adoption Framework Azure Migration landing zone Blueprint sample](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/blueprints/samples/caf-migrate-landing-zone/).

1. In the Azure portal's left navigation, select **+ Create a resource**, then search for and select **Storage account**, followed by **Create**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the create storage account navigation.](Images/1.1.png "Storage account - Create")

2. In the **Create storage account** blade, on the **Basics** tab, use the following values:

   - Subscription: **Select your Azure subscription (1)**.
  
   - Resource group: **AzureMigrateRG (2)**
  
   - Storage account name: **migrationstorage<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (3)**

   - Location: Select **<inject key="Region" enableCopy="false" /> (4)** from the dropdown.
    
   - Performance: **Standard (5)**
  
   - Redundancy: **Locally-redundant storage (LRS) (6)**

   > **Note:** For simplicity, in this lab you will not configure the migrated VMs for high availability, since each application tier is implemented using a single VM.

7. On the **Compute** tab, select the below configuration,

   - Select the **Standard_F2s_v2** VM size for each virtual machine. 

   - Select the **Windows** operating system for the **smarthotelweb1**, **smarthotelweb2** virtual machines.

   - Select the **Linux** operating system for the **UbuntuWAF** virtual machine. 

   - Select **Next**. 

   ![Screenshot of the 'Compute' tab of the 'Replicate' wizard in Azure Migrate Server Migration. Each VM is configured to use a Standard_F2s_v2 SKU, and has the OS Type specified.](Images/upd-replicate-6.png "Replicate - Compute")
    

9. In the **Disks** tab, review the settings but do not make any changes. Select **Next: Tags**, then select **Replicate** to start the server replication.

10. In the **Azure Migrate - Servers, databases and web apps** blade, under **Migration and modernization**, select the **Overview** button.

     ![Screenshot of the 'Azure Migrate - Servers' blade with the 'Overview' button in the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration' panel highlighted.](Images/newoverviewreplication.png "Overview link")
    
11. Confirm that the 3 machines are replicating.

     ![Screenshot of the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration' overview blade showing the replication state as 'Healthy' for 3 servers.](Images/upd-overviewnew.png "Replication summary")

12. Select **Replications (1)** under **Migration** on the left.  Select **Refresh (2)** occasionally and wait until all three machines have a **Protected (3)** status, which shows the initial replication is complete. This will take 5-10 minutes.

     ![Screenshot of the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration - Replicating machines' blade showing the replication status as 'Protected' for all 3 servers.](Images/upd-replicate-09.png "Replication status")

#### Task summary 

In this task, you enabled replication from the Hyper-V host to Azure Migrate and configured the replicated VM size in Azure.

### Task 4: Configure Networking

In this task, you will modify the settings for each replicated VM to use a static private IP address that matches the on-premises IP addresses for that machine.

1. Still using the **Migration and modernization - Replicating** blade, select the **smarthotelweb1** virtual machine. This opens a detailed migration and replication blade for this machine. Take a moment to study this information.

    ![Screenshot from the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration - Replicating machines' blade with the smarthotelweb1 machine highlighted.](Images/upd-config-0.png "Replicating machines")

2. Select **Compute and Network (1)** under **General** on the left, then select **Edit (2)**.

    ![Screenshot of the smarthotelweb1 blade with the 'Compute and Network' and 'Edit' links highlighted.](Images/upd-config-1.png "Edit Compute and Network settings")

3. Confirm that the VM is configured to use the **F2s_v2** VM size.

4. Under **Network Interfaces**, select **InternalNATSwitch** to open the network interface settings.

    ![Screenshot showing the link to edit the network interface settings for a replicated VM.](Images/upd-nic.png "Network Interface settings link")

5. Change the **Private IP address** to **192.168.0.4**

    ![Screenshot showing a private IP address being configured for a replicated VM in ASR.](Images/upd-private-ip.png "Network interface - static private IP address")

6. Select **OK** to close the network interface settings blade, then **Save** the **smarthotelweb1** settings.

7. Repeat these steps to configure the private IP address for the other VMs.
 
   - For **smarthotelweb2** use private IP address **192.168.0.5**
  
   - For **UbuntuWAF** use private IP address **192.168.0.8**

#### Task summary 

In this task, you modified the settings for each replicated VM to use a static private IP address that matches the on-premises IP addresses for that machine

> **Note**: Azure Migrate makes a "best guess" at the VM settings, but you have full control over the settings of migrated items. In this case, setting a static private IP address ensures the virtual machines in Azure retain the same IPs they had on-premises, which avoids having to reconfigure the VMs during migration (for example, by editing web.config files).

### Task 5: Server migration

In this task, you will perform a migration of the UbuntuWAF, smarthotelweb1, and smarthotelweb2 machines to Azure.

> **Note**: In a real-world scenario, you would perform a test migration before the final migration. To save time, you will skip the test migration in this lab. The test migration process is very similar to the final migration.

1. Return to the **Migration and modernization** overview blade. Under **Step 3: Migrate**, select **Migrate**.

    ![Screenshot of the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration' overview blade, with the 'Migrate' button highlighted.](Images/upd-migrate-1.png "Replication summary")

2. On the **Specify intent** tab, Select **Azure VM** under Where do you want to migrate to? and select **Continue**.

    ![Screenshot of the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration' overview blade, with the 'Migrate' button highlighted.](Images/06-05-2024(7).png "Replication summary")

3. On the **Migrate** blade, select **yes (1)** for **Shutdown machines before migration to minimum data loss** and select the 3 virtual machines **(2)** then select **Migrate (3)** to start the migration process.

    ![Screenshot of the 'Migrate' blade, with 3 machines selected and the 'Migrate' button highlighted.](Images/upd-e3-t6-s2.png "Migrate - VM selection")

   > **Note**: You can optionally choose whether the on-premises virtual machines should be automatically shut down before migration to minimize data loss. Either setting will work for this lab.

4. The migration process will start.

    ![Screenshot showing 3 VM migration notifications.](Images/upd-migrate-3.png "Migration started notifications")

5. To monitor progress, select **Jobs (1)** under **Migration** on the left and review the status of the three **Planned failover (2)** jobs.

    ![Screenshot showing the **Jobs* link and a jobs list with 3 in-progress 'Planned failover' jobs.](Images/upd-migrate-04.png "Migration jobs")

6. **Wait** until all three **Planned failover** jobs show a **Status** of **Successful**. You should not need to refresh your browser. This could take up to 15 minutes.

    ![Screenshot showing the **Jobs* link and a jobs list with all 'Planned failover' jobs successful.](Images/upd-migrate-5.png "Migration status")

7. Navigate to the **SmartHotelHostRG** resource group and check that the VM, network interface, and disk resources have been created for each of the virtual machines being migrated.

    ![Screenshot showing resources created by the test failover (VMs, disks, and network interfaces).](Images/upd-migrate-6.png "Migrated resources")

#### Task summary

In this task, I migrated the **UbuntuWAF**, **smarthotelweb1**, and **smarthotelweb2** VMs to Azure. I initiated the migration process, monitored progress, and confirmed the successful creation of the resources in the **SmartHotelHostRG** resource group.

### Summary

In this lab, you had learned to migrate Windows Servers from Hyper-V to Azure using Azure Migrate: Server Migration. Created a storage account for migration data, registered the Hyper-V host with Azure Migrate, and enabled replication of on-premises VMs. Configured static private IP addresses for the replicated VMs and performed their migration to Azure, ensuring successful deployment and resource creation in the target resource group.
