# HOL3: Exercise 2: Configure ASR for On-premises Infrastructure


### Estimated time: 30 Minutes

In this exercise, you will deploy disaster recovery of an on-premises Hyper-V VM to Azure. The Azure Site Recovery service contributes to your disaster-recovery strategy by managing and orchestrating replication, failover, and failback of on-premises machines. As part of the registration process, you will deploy the Azure Site Recovery Provider on your Hyper-V host.

## Lab objectives

In this exercise, you will complete the following task:

- Task 1: Configure ASR to on-premises infrastructure

## Task 1: Configure ASR to on-premises infrastructure

In this task, you will configure Azure Site Recovery (ASR) to replicate an on-premises Hyper-V VM to Azure.

1. In the **search resources, services and docs bar**, type **Recovery services vaults (1)**. From the dropdown results under **Services**, click on **Recovery Services vaults (2)**.

1. On the Recovery services vaults, click on **SmartHotelMigration<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />-MigrateVault** which we have configured in the previous HOL1 task.

1. On **Enable replication** page, under the **Target environment** tab, fill in the following details:

   - Post-failover resource group: **SmartHotelRG (1)**
   
   - Replica Storage type: **Storage account (2)**

   - Storage account: select the storage account created in the previous HOL **migrationstorage<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (3)** available in the drop-down list.   
   
   - Virtual network: **SmartHotelVNet (4)**

   - Subnet: **SmartHotel (5)**
   
   - Leave other values as default and click on **Next (6)**
   
       ![](Images/infra-l11-2.png)
    
1. In the **Virtual machine selection** tab, check the box next to **AzureArcVM (1)** and click on **Next (2)** to proceed.

### Summary 

In this exercise, you explored how to set up Azure and on-premises prerequisites and create a Recovery Services vault for Site Recovery. Then you learn how to set up the source and target replication environments and create a replication policy to enable replication for a server.
