# HOL2: Exercise 4: Optimizing newly Migrated Workloads and Emphasizing commonalities across all Stacks

### Estimated time: 40 Minutes

In this exercise, you will enable the Managed Identity feature and configure Azure Active Directory (AAD) based authentication for SSH login by deploying a VM extension on virtual machines. Additionally, you'll activate Automanage on existing machines to streamline configuration and monitoring. This process simplifies identity management and automates the operational tasks necessary for managing VMs efficiently in Azure, ensuring enhanced security and compliance across your cloud environment.

## Lab objectives

In this exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Getting Started with Azure Active Directory for Linux
- Task 2: Azure Automanage

### Task 1: Getting Started with Azure Active Directory for Linux 

In this task, you will be enabling the AAD authentication using a VM extension and enabling Managed Identity. 

1. In the Azure portal `https://portal.azure.com`, navigate to your newly migrated **Red Hat** VM and select it.

1. On the **Enable Automanage** page, select the following details.

     - Filter the list by your Subscription and Resource group and click on **Check eligibility on machines (1)**.
   
     - **Check the checkbox of the Red Hat virtual machine (2)**
   
     - Click on the **Review + Create (3)** button.
   
        ![](Images/15-7-25-l8-12.png)

1. On the **Review + Create** tab, verify the selected configuration and click **Create** to enable Automanage. Once the Configuration profile assignment is completed successfully, it will take around **5-10 minutes** to get the Status as Conformant.
