# Guided Lab : Infrastructure Migration
 
### Overall Estimated Duration: 6 Hours

## Overview
In this lab, you will learn how to migrate Linux-based virtual machines from an on-premises Hyper-V environment to Microsoft Azure using Azure Migrate and Azure Site Recovery (ASR). The process involves preparing a Red Hat Linux VM, registering the Hyper-V host with Azure Migrate, and enabling replication to Azure. You will also configure networking for the VM and perform the migration, ensuring it aligns with best practices for scalability and security in Azure. By completing this lab, you will gain hands-on experience with migrating Linux servers to Azure, leveraging Microsoft services and tools for a seamless transition to the cloud.

## Objectives
Learn how to create and manage Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) in Azure by capturing images from existing virtual machines and automating best practices with Azure Automanage. By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Migrate Linux Workloads from Hyper-V to Azure:** Successfully migrate Linux Server from Hyper-V to Azure by preparing the environment, configuring replication, executing the migration, and applying core networking and security best practices.

## Pre-requisites
To effectively complete this lab, you need basic knowledge of Microsoft Azure, Hyper-V virtualization, and virtual machine management. You should also be familiar with using the Azure portal, configuring storage accounts, and understanding fundamental networking and security concepts.

## Architecture
In this hands-on lab, you will follow the architecture flow illustrated in the diagram, focusing on migrating Linux-based virtual machines (VMs) from an on-premises Hyper-V environment to Azure. The process begins by registering your on-premises Hyper-V host with Azure Migrate and deploying the Azure Site Recovery (ASR) provider on the Hyper-V host. You will then enable replication to synchronize the Linux VMs’ data to an Azure Storage account. After replication, you will configure networking settings to ensure consistency with on-premises configurations, including setting static IP addresses. Finally, the migration process will move the VMs into Azure as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) instances. Throughout the lab, you will apply best practices for networking, security, and scalability to ensure a smooth and efficient migration to the cloud.
