# HOL1: Exercise 3: Migrating your applications and data by utilizing Microsoft services and tools, such as Azure Migrate: Server Migration

### Estimated time: 60 Minutes

In this exercise, you will learn about Azure migration and how all pre-migration steps, such as discovery, assessments, and right-sizing of on-premises resources, are included for infrastructure, data, and applications. Azure Migrate provides a simplified migration, modernization, and optimization service for Azure.

## Lab objectives

In this exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Create a Storage Account
- Task 2: Register the Hyper-V Host with Migration and modernization
- Task 3: Enable Replication from Hyper-V to Azure Migrate
- Task 4: Configure Networking
- Task 5: Server migration

## Task 1: Create a Storage Account

In this task, you will create a new Azure Storage Account that will be used by Migration and for the storage of your virtual machine data during migration.

> **Note:** This lab focuses on the technical tools for workload migration, but in real-world scenarios, a comprehensive long-term plan is needed. Considerations for the landing zone should include network traffic, access control, resource organization, and governance. The CAF Migration and Foundation Blueprints can help deploy a pre-defined landing zone using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for resource management. For more details, refer to [Azure Landing Zones](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/) and the [Cloud Adoption Framework Azure Migration landing zone Blueprint sample](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/blueprints/samples/caf-migrate-landing-zone/).

#### Task summary 

In this task, you enabled replication from the Hyper-V host to Azure Migrate and configured the replicated VM size in Azure.

### Task 4: Configure Networking

In this task, you will modify the settings for each replicated VM to use a static private IP address that matches the on-premises IP addresses for that machine.

1. In the **Azure Migrate: Server Migration** page, select the **smarthotelweb1** virtual machine. This opens a detailed migration and replication blade for this machine. Take a moment to study this information.

    ![Screenshot from the 'Azure Migrate: Server Migration - Replicating machines' blade with the smarthotelweb1 machine highlighted.](Images/15-7-25-l2-31.png "Replicating machines")

1. On the left menu, expand **General (1)** and select **Compute and Network (2)**. Under the **Microsoft Azure** column, verify the **Size** is set to **F2s_v2** **(3)**.

    ![Screenshot of the smarthotelweb1 blade with the 'Compute and Network' and 'Edit' links highlighted.](Images/15-7-25-l2-32.png "Edit Compute and Network settings")

1. In the **Compute and Network** section, scroll down to the **Network interfaces**. Select the **pencil icon** (✏️) next to the NIC name.
    
    ![Screenshot showing the link to edit the network interface settings for a replicated VM.](Images/15-7-25-l2-33.png "Network Interface settings link")

1. In the **Network interface** settings:

    - Under **IP address type**, select **Static** **(1)**.
    - In the **Private IP address** field, enter: `192.168.0.4` **(2)**.
    - Select **Apply** **(3)** to save the changes.

       ![Screenshot showing a private IP address being configured for a replicated VM in ASR.](Images/15-7-25-l2-34.png "Network interface - static private IP address")

1. Select **Save** to apply the changes to the VM's configuration.

    ![](Images/15-7-25-l2-35.png)

1. Repeat these steps to configure the private IP address for the other VMs.
 
   - For **smarthotelweb2** use private IP address **192.168.0.5**
  
   - For **UbuntuWAF** use private IP address **192.168.0.8**

#### Task summary 

In this task, you modified the settings for each replicated VM to use a static private IP address that matches the on-premises IP addresses for that machine

> **Note**: Azure Migrate makes a "best guess" at the VM settings, but you have full control over the settings of migrated items. In this case, setting a static private IP address ensures the virtual machines in Azure retain the same IPs they had on-premises, which avoids having to reconfigure the VMs during migration (for example, by editing web.config files).

### Task 5: Server migration

In this task, you will perform a migration of the UbuntuWAF, smarthotelweb1, and smarthotelweb2 machines to Azure.

> **Note**: In a real-world scenario, you would perform a test migration before the final migration. To save time, you will skip the test migration in this lab. The test migration process is very similar to the final migration.

1. On the **Azure Migrate: Server Migration** page, click on **Overview (1) section** and under **Migrate to Azure**, select **Migrate (2)**.

    ![](Images/15-7-25-l2-36.png)

1. On the **Specify Intent** page, select **Azure VM (1)** for **Where do you want to migrate to?** and click on **Continue (2)**

    ![](Images/15-7-25-l2-37.png)
   
1. On the **Migrate** page, select the 3 VMs **(1)**, choose **Yes, Shutdown virtual machines (Ensure no data loss) (2)** under the **Shutdown virtual machines** section, and click **Migrate (3)** to start the migration.

    ![Screenshot of the 'Migrate' blade, with 3 machines selected and the 'Migrate' button highlighted.](Images/15-7-25-l2-38.png)

   > **Note**: You can optionally choose whether the on-premises virtual machines should be automatically shut down before migration to minimize data loss. Either setting will work for this lab.

1. On the **Azure Migrate: Server Migration** page, to monitor progress, expand **Migration (1)** on the left menu and select **Jobs (2)** and review the status of the three **Planned failover (3)** jobs.

    ![Screenshot showing the **Jobs* link and a jobs list with 3 in-progress 'Planned failover' jobs.](Images/15-7-25-l2-39.png "Migration jobs")

1. **Wait** until all three **Planned failover** jobs show a **Status** of **Successful**. You should not need to refresh your browser. This could take up to **15 minutes**.

    ![Screenshot showing the **Jobs* link and a jobs list with all 'Planned failover' jobs successful.](Images/15-7-25-l2-40.png "Migration status")

1. Navigate to the resource group, on the **Resource group** page, select the **SmartHotelHostRG** resource group. and check that the VM, network interface, and disk resources have been created for each of the virtual machines being migrated.

### Summary 

In this exercise, you created an Azure Storage Account for VM data migration. The Hyper-V host (LabVM) was registered with the Migration and Modernization service, using Azure Site Recovery for migration. You deployed the Azure Site Recovery Provider on the Hyper-V host and configured replication for on-premises VMs to the Azure Migrate Server Migration service. Static private IPs were set for the replicated VMs to match their on-premises configurations. Finally, the UbuntuWAF, smarthotelweb1, and smarthotelweb2 VMs were successfully migrated to Azure.
