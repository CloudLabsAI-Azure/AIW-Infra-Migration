# HOL1: Exercise 1: Migrating Windows & SQL Server workloads

### Estimated time: 60 Minutes

In this HOL, you will use Azure Migrate: Server Assessment to assess the on-premises environment. This will include selecting Azure Migrate tools, deploying the Azure Migrate appliance into the on-premises environment, creating a migration assessment, and using the Azure Migrate dependency visualization.

## Lab objectives

In this HOL, you will complete the following task:

- Task 1: Discovery, Assess, and Plan: Evaluate your current environment

### Task 1: Discovery, Assess, and Plan: Evaluate your current environment

In this task, you will deploy the Azure Migrate appliance in the on-premises Hyper-V environment. This appliance communicates with the Hyper-V server to gather configuration and performance data about your on-premises VMs and returns that data to your Azure Migrate project.

1. If you are not logged in already, click on the **Azure portal** shortcut that is available on the desktop and log in with the below Azure credentials.
    
    - Enter your **Username/Email:** <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject> in the **Sign in** field. Click **Next** to continue.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate 'Discover machines' blade showing the Azure Migrate project key.](Images/infra-l1-1.png)

1.  Read through the instructions on how to download, deploy, and configure the Azure Migrate appliance, then close the 'Discover machines' blade by clicking on the cross button **X** (do **not** download the .VHD file or .ZIP file, the .VHD has already been downloaded for you). 
 
    ![Screenshot of the closing the blade.](Images/15-7-25-l1-6.png "Closing the Azure migrate appliance blade")

1. As we have created the Azure Migrate project key for the Discover and Assessment, you will be accessing the Hyper-V manager in the next tasks to start the discovery process with the help of the Azure Migrate Appliance.

1. On the lab VM, click the **Start (1)** button, search for **Hyper-V Manager (2)**, and select  **Hyper-V Manager (3)** from the results. You will use Hyper-V Manager to access your infrastructure and connect to the Azure Migrate Appliance VM to begin discovery.

    > You can also open the Hyper-V Manager by clicking on the ![](Images/Icon-hyperv.png) icon in the taskbar.

      ![Screenshot of Hyper-V Manager, with the 'Hyper-V Manager' action highlighted.](Images/15-7-25-l1-7.png "Hyper-V Manager")

1. In Hyper-V Manager, select **HOSTVMS<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (1)** from the left pane. You should now see the AzureMigrateAppliance VM along with other VMs **(2)** that make up the on-premises SmartHotel application and will be used in upcoming hands-on labs.

    ![Screenshot of Hyper-V Manager on the SmartHotelHost.](Images/15-7-25-l1-8.png "Hyper-V Manager")

        ![](Images/15-7-25-l1-22.png)
       
1. Once signed in, return to the Azure Migrate Appliance tab the appliance registration will begin automatically and display The appliance has been successfully registered once complete.

   ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard, showing the registration with the Azure Migrate project as completed.](Images/15-7-25-l1-23.png "Appliance registered")

1. Once registration is complete, navigate to the **Manage credentials and discovery sources** panel. Under **Step 1: Provide Hyper-V host credentials for discovery of Hyper-V VMs**, click **Add credentials** to proceed.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard, showing the 'Add credentials' button.](Images/15-7-25-l1-24.png)

1. On the **Add credentials** tab, enter the following details for the Hyper-V host/cluster that the appliance will use to discover VMs, and then click **Save (4)** to continue.
 
      - Friendly name: Enter **hostlogin (1)** 
      - Username: **<inject key="SmartHotelHost Admin Username" /> (2)**
      - Password: **<inject key="SmartHotelHost Admin Password" /> (3)**

        ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard, showing the 'Add credentials' panel.](Images/15-7-25-l1-25.png "Credentials")

        > **Note**: The Azure Migrate appliance may not have picked up your local keyboard mapping. Select the 'eyeball' in the password box to check that the password was entered correctly.

1. In **Step 2: Provide Hyper-V host/cluster details**, click **Add discovery source** to specify the IP address or FQDN of the Hyper-V host/cluster
   
    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard, showing the 'Add discovery source' button.](Images/15-7-25-l1-26.png "Add discovery source")

1. On the **Add discovery source** blade, provide the following details:
     
      - Select **Add single item (1)**
      - IP Address / FQDN:  Enter **HOSTVMS<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (2)** 
      - Map credentials: Select **hostlogin (3)** from the dropdown and 
      - Select **Save (4)**.

        ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard, showing the 'Add discovery source' panel.](Images/15-7-25-l1-27.png "Discovery source - SmartHotelHost")

         > **Note:** You can either **Add single item** at a time or **Add multiple items** in one go. There is also an option to provide Hyper-V host/cluster details through **Import CSV**.

1. Once the discovery source is added, the appliance will validate the connection to the Hyper-V host/cluster. A **Validation successful** status will be displayed in the table next to the corresponding host or cluster.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Migrate appliance configuration wizard, showing the successful validation of the configured discovery source.](Images/15-7-25-l1-28.png "Discovery source - validation successful")

    > **Note:** When adding discovery sources:
    > - For successfully validated hosts/clusters, you can view more details by selecting their IP address/FQDN.
    > - If validation fails for a host, review the error by selecting Validation failed in the Status column of the table. Fix the issue and validate again.
    > - To remove hosts or clusters, select **Delete**.
    > - You can't remove a specific host from a cluster. You can only remove the entire cluster.
    > - You can add a cluster, even if there are issues with specific hosts in the cluster.

1. In **Step 3: Provide server credentials to perform guest discovery of installed software, dependencies and workloads**, **Disable** the slider, and then select **Start discovery**  to begin VM discovery from the validated Hyper-V hosts or clusters.

   >**Note:** The discovery process may take up to 10 minutes to complete
   
   ![](Images/15-7-25-l1-29.png)
    
   ![](Images/15-7-25-l1-30.png)

1. Wait for the Azure Migrate status to show that **Discovery has been successfully initiated**. This will take several minutes. After the discovery has been successfully initiated, you can check the discovery status against each host/cluster in the table. (Wait for the Azure Migrate status to display . Discovery has been successfully initiated. This may take several minutes. Once initiated, you can view the discovery status for each host or cluster in the table.)
  
    ![](Images/infra-l1-2.png)

1.  Return to the **LabvmVM**, then navigate to the **Azure Migrate** page in the Azure portal. Under **Migration goals**, select **Servers, databases and web apps (1)**, then click **Refresh (2)**. In the **Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment** panel, you should see a count of **Discovered servers (3)**. If discovery is still in progress, continue clicking Refresh periodically until all 7 servers are shown. This may take several minutes.

    ![](Images/15-7-25-l1-31.png) 

    > **Note:** **Wait for the discovery process to complete before proceeding to the next Task**.

### Summary
