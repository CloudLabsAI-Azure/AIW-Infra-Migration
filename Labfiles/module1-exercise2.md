# HOL1: Exercise 2: Set up your Environment on Azure to Migrate Servers

### Estimated time: 40 Minutes

In this exercise, you'll assess the migration readiness of the SmartHotel application using Azure Migrate. First, you'll create an assessment for selected VMs, setting up and grouping them to generate a report that shows whether they're ready for migration to Azure.

Next, you'll configure dependency visualization by installing monitoring agents on the VMs. This will help you map out and understand the dependencies between different application parts, ensuring everything works properly before migrating to Azure.

## Lab objectives

In this exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Create a migration assessment
- Task 2: Configure dependency visualization

### Task 1: Create a migration assessment

In this task, you will use Azure Migrate to create a migration assessment for the SmartHotel application, using the data gathered during the discovery phase.

1. On **Assessments tools**, under **Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment**, click on **Assess** **(1)** and select **Azure VM** **(2)** from the dropdown to start a new migration assessment.

### Task 2: Configure dependency visualization

When migrating a workload to Azure, it is important to understand all workload dependencies. A broken dependency could mean that the application does not run properly in Azure, perhaps in hard-to-detect ways. Some dependencies, such as those between application tiers, are obvious. Other dependencies, such as DNS lookups, Kerberos ticket validation, or certificate revocation checks, are not.

In this task, you will configure the Azure Migrate dependency visualization feature. This requires you to first create a Log Analytics workspace and then deploy agents on the to-be-migrated VMs.

1. Return to the **Azure Migrate** blade in the Azure portal, Select **Servers, databases and web apps** **(1)** under **Migration goals** section. Under **Discovery and assessment**, click on the number next to **Groups** **(2)** to view the available groups.
