# Migrate Windows Server to Azure

### Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you will explore how Azure Migrate simplifies the migration of applications and data to Azure. You will learn to perform key pre-migration tasks, including discovery, assessments, and resource right-sizing. The lab covers configuring replication from on-premises Hyper-V hosts to Azure and executing server migrations, ensuring smooth operation through proper networking configurations. Additionally, you’ll gain valuable insights into Azure Networking and Security to support successful infrastructure migration.

## Objective 

This exercise focuses on enhancing your skills in migrating applications and data to Azure using Azure Migrate and related services. By completing this lab, you will learn:

1. **Pre-migration steps with Azure Migrate:** Understand how to perform discovery, assessments, and right-sizing of on-premises resources for infrastructure, data, and applications.

2. **Replication and migration:** Configure replication from on-premises Hyper-V hosts to Azure and migrate virtual machines using Azure Migrate Server Migration.

3. **Networking configuration:** Modify replicated VM settings to ensure proper networking, including static private IP assignments for seamless integration.

4. **Server Migration :** Select Azure VM as the destination, choose to shut down VMs before migration for minimal data loss, and monitor progress through the Jobs section. Verify the creation of VM, network interface, and disk resources in the target resource group after migration.

## Prerequisites

1. **Azure Migration Knowledge:** Understanding of Azure Migrate, server migration, and related tools for seamless cloud transition.

2. **Hyper-V and VMware Administration:** Familiarity with Hyper-V and VMware environments for managing on-premises virtual machines.

3. **Networking and Security Basics:** Knowledge of networking concepts, static IP addressing, and security configurations for VM migrations.
   
## Architecture

In this hands-on lab, you will follow a structured workflow to migrate applications and data to Azure using Azure Migrate: Server Migration. The process begins with creating a storage account and registering your on-premises Hyper-V host with the Migration and Modernization service, leveraging Azure Site Recovery as the migration engine. You will then enable replication of virtual machines to Azure, configure networking for seamless integration, and perform server migrations. Additionally, you will explore Azure Networking and Security best practices, gaining a comprehensive understanding of the tools and services that support successful migration to Azure.
